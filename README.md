#📊Telemetry Trends: IoT Sensor Data Analysis
Welcome to the Telemetry Trends project! This repository showcases a comprehensive analysis of IoT telemetry data, focusing on identifying key trends, detecting anomalies, and predicting sensor behavior. It's a complete end-to-end data analytics project using PySpark and Python, designed for big data workflows.

🚀 Project Overview
The rise of IoT devices has created an influx of telemetry data, making it vital to uncover meaningful insights for effective monitoring and decision-making. This project analyzes telemetry data from IoT devices to:
 Explore and visualize trends in sensor metrics like temperature, humidity, CO levels, and more.
 Detect anomalies to identify unusual device behavior.
 Predict future sensor readings for proactive monitoring.

Key Steps Covered:
 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights through statistical and visual exploration.
 Anomaly Detection: Highlighting outliers using Z-scores.
 Predictive Modeling: Building regression models to predict sensor performance.

   🛠️ Tools & Technologies
PySpark: Scalable big data processing and analysis.
Pandas & Matplotlib: Data manipulation and visualization.
Seaborn: Advanced visualizations.
Scikit-learn: Building regression models for prediction.

📈 Key Insights
Exploratory Data Analysis: Sensor readings such as temperature and humidity exhibit clear seasonal trends.
Strong correlations observed between CO and smoke levels.
Anomaly Detection: Anomalies in CO and smoke levels often align with potential device malfunctions.
Predictive Modeling: A linear regression model achieved an RMSE of 0.012, accurately predicting temperature readings.
